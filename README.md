### Snippet - Python | Flask-Backend
Code below requests current user specific posts. Using the User's id, which was saved in each post when created, we found all of the user's posts. Then use the response data to populate the their Cellar (Profile Page).

```
class UserPostList(Resource):
    def __init__(self):
        self.reqparse = reqparse.RequestParser()
        self.reqparse.add_argument(
            'posted_by',
            required=False,
            help='username is required to post',
            location=['form', 'json']
        )
        super().__init__()
    # @marshal_with(post_fields)
    def get(self, id):
        posts = [marshal(post, post_fields) for post in models.Post.select().where(models.Post.posted_by==id)]
        return posts
```

### User Story:
1. User must confirm that they are over 21 years of age.
2. User can register or login.
3. Once the user is logged, they are able to access the explore and cellar features of the application
4. Explore is populated with all posts, and the Feed feature will be populated with posts by users that the current user has designated as friends or decided to follow.
5. In Explore, the user is able to create a New Post. When a user selects "New Post", the user can upload a photo along with information like the name of the wine, the vintage, and a comment.
6. The Cellar contains the user's profile info, and all of the current user's posts. Here, both the user's profile and posts are editable.

2. User Logout function
